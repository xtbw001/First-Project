# First-Project

My name is Tyler Wilson

I am learning code to help prepare me for a world that is becoming more and more dependent on technology and the effective application of it in the business world.  I feel that writing code is undervalued skill in our society and should be taught in schools a part of the core curriculum.  Through this program I hope to learn enough to at least code for fun as a hobbie.
